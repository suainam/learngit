#### work place and repostiory
- learngit is my work place
- git add, can add my file, for example, readme.md, to .git/stage[index]
- git commit, can add the files in stage to current branch (eg. master)
**git will only commit the files in stage, if you modify you file after git add, you use commit will only commit the last distribute, not the newest modify**
**git manage the changes, not the files**

#### how to discard the changes
1. before in stage, use "git checkout -- filename" to discard the changes in work place
2. in stage, use " git reset HEAD filename" to unstage the file, and use step 1 
3. if you had commit the changes to your computer repostiory, you need use " git reset --hard HEAD~1" to rollback

#### remove the files
1. "git add file", in workplace, you "rm test.txt", and git will know it, you nedd "git rm test.txt", and "git commit -m "remove file"
2. after you remove the file, you regret to do it. you need "git checkout -- file" to replace the file in workplace(evenif it's empty)

#### github
- create sshkey
    - in user profiles, find ".ssh" and "id_rsa id_ras.pub" in it, if not exists:
    	- ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@gmail.com"
		- just press enter is ok
	- "id_rsa.pub" is public
    - login github, "account setting", "ssh keys", "add ssh key", copy the content of "id_rsa.pub"
and paste it here
    
#### remote origin
```bash
# create your repository on github, eg. learngit
git remote add orgin git@github.com:yourusername/learngit.git
git push  -u origin master
# when you first push, "-u" will bulid a realtionships between master on your desktop and origin, it need'tafter 
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/learngit.git
#clone from origin. git@github.com is git://, use ssh, https:// is also useful, but maybe slowly.
```

#### branch
```bash
git checkout -b dev # create dev branch and checkout
# git branch dev, git checkout dev
git branch 
# *dev, master

# vim a new file, and add it to stage, then commit it. 
git checkout master
git merge dev
# switched to branch master, and merge dev

git branch -d dev
# after merged, delete dev
```
